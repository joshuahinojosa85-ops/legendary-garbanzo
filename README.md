## 🧠 About Neural Nexus
Neural Nexus Systems is an independent technical initiative focused on **cybersecurity, system architecture, and precision computing**.  
Founded with the belief that technology should not merely function but **protect, evolve, and inspire**, Neural Nexus fuses **engineering discipline**, **design intuition**, and **security consciousness** into every digital construct.

### Core Tenets
- **Integrity in Code:** Every function has a purpose. Every line has intent.  
- **Defense by Design:** Security isn’t an add-on — it’s built into the architecture.  
- **Human + Machine Symbiosis:** Smart systems should empower, not overwhelm.
